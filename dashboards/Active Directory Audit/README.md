# 🛡️ Active Directory Audit Dashboards

This repository contains a **collection of Dynatrace dashboards** designed to provide **deep visibility into Active Directory activity, security events, and change auditing**.

⚠️ **Important:** This is **not a single dashboard**. It is a **set of multiple dashboards**, each focused on a specific Active Directory use case such as logins, lockouts, password changes, group modifications, GPO changes, and file auditing.

Together, these dashboards enable security, IAM, and operations teams to **detect anomalies faster, investigate incidents efficiently, and support compliance requirements**.
