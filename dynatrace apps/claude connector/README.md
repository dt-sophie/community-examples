# Claude Connector for Dynatrace Workflows
Connect Claude with Dynatrace using this action for Workflows. It allows to define a prompt, execute within Claude and receive and process the result and data within Dynatrace for further analysis.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Connect:** manage connections to Claude with support for different models (using API key)
- **Execute prompt:** define and execute the prompt defined in the workflow action
- **Handle response:** store and analyze response

## 🖥️ Using the workflow action
Follow these steps to set up an automated AI analysis workflow in Dynatrace:

### 1. Fetch your data
Create a new workflow and add a task to fetch the data you want analyzed (e.g., logs, events, or metrics).

- **Action:** Add a DQL Query task named execute_dql_query.
- Example Query:
    ```sql
    fetch logs  
    | filter matchesValue(status, "ERROR")  
    | summarize count=count(), by:{content}  
    | limit 10
    ```

### 2. (Optional) Data Optimization
To save on token costs and improve response accuracy, use a script to extract only the necessary records before sending them to Claude.

- Action: Add a **Run JavaScript** task.
- Code:
```js
import { execution, result } from "@dynatrace-sdk/automation-utils";

export default async function () {
  // Ensure the string matches your DQL task name
  const taskExecutionResult = await result("execute_dql_query");
  return taskExecutionResult['records'];
}
```

### 3. Configure the Claude Task
- Add a new task and search for **Claude**.

- Under **Input**, click + **Create a new connection**.

- Enter a **Connection Name**, your **Model ID**, and your **API Key** (which you can generate here: https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

> Note: Do not modify the URL unless you are using a custom endpoint.

- Click **Add item**. Your connection should now show up on the Connection dropdown for the task (refresh page if not).

### 4. Set up the Prompt
- **Prompt:** Enter the specific question or instruction for the AI (e.g., "Analyze these logs and suggest a potential root cause").
- **Name of Task with data to analyze:** Enter the exact name of the task from Step 1 (or Step 2 if you used the optimization script).

### 5. (Optional) Store the AI Response
You can archive Claude's analysis back into Dynatrace as a log for long-term tracking.

- Add a **Run JavaScript** task.
- Use the Dynatrace SDK to ingest the task output as a log, sample code below.

```js
import { execution, result } from "@dynatrace-sdk/automation-utils";
import { logsClient } from '@dynatrace-sdk/client-classic-environment-v2';

export default async function () {
  const taskExecutionResult = await result('claude_1');

  console.log('print: ', taskExecutionResult.response);
  
  return await logsClient.storeLog({
    body: [
      {
        'content': taskExecutionResult.response,
        'log.source': 'Claude',
        'type': 'AI Summary',
      }
    ],
    type: 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
  });
}
```
To view your AI summaries later, run the following in the **Logs** app:
```js
fetch logs
| filter matchesValue(type, "AI Summary") AND matchesValue(log.source, "Claude")
```
